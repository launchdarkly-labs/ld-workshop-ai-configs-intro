# Otto is in production

Otto has been live for a couple of pretend-days. ToggleWear shoppers have been chatting with him and giving him thumbs-up and thumbs-down ratings. (Behind the scenes, setup ran a traffic generator that fed Otto ~120 fake sessions while you were starting this lab.)

The point of this challenge is to *look*. You're not going to change anything. You're going to use the AgentControl monitoring view the same way you'd use it the morning after a real launch — to answer the question, "Is Otto working?"

# Open the monitoring view

Open the [LaunchDarkly](#tab-0) tab.

1. Go to **Configs** → **Otto Assistant**.
2. Click the **Monitoring** tab.
3. Set the environment filter to **Test**.

You should see a populated dashboard. Take a minute to look at it before reading further.

# Things to look for

The monitoring view shows your AgentControl's performance broken down by variation. Compare **Otto (Born)** to **Otto (Premium)**:

- **Generations**: how many times each variation was served. Born will be busier because most simulated shoppers were free-tier.
- **Input / output tokens**: tokens by variation. Premium (Sonnet) writes longer answers, so output tokens are higher.
- **Latency**: Sonnet is slower than Haiku. The premium variation should show a higher median latency.
- **Positive vs. negative feedback**: both variations score well, but Premium scores noticeably better. That's not magic — it's the model. The traffic generator weighted positive feedback higher for Sonnet because, in practice, you'd expect a more capable model to produce more on-brand answers.

# Questions to ask yourself

- If you had to pick **one** variation based on this data, which would you pick?
- The Premium variation costs more per call (bigger model, more output tokens). Is the positive-feedback delta worth the cost difference? Where would you look to find the cost data?
- What would you change about the data collection? (Are thumbs-up / thumbs-down enough? Would you also want a numeric quality score? Latency thresholds?)

# What happens next

Otto is healthy in `Test`, and that is where Build ends: you created him, gave him a voice, factored that voice into reusable snippets, split him into Free and Premium variations, and read his first production dashboard. The next track, **Evaluate**, starts from exactly this state and asks the harder question: how do you *prove* Otto is good, and what should happen automatically when he isn't?

Click **Check** when you've had a good look around the monitoring view.
